Right now, we're building a company-wide place for managing the company's data assets. It should become a single workspace where engineers, data scientists, data analytics, products, and managers can cooperate on top of the data assets.

Several weeks ago I was invited to have a conversation about modern data stacks and Data Catalogs particularly. So, here it is, the podcast. Hope you will find it useful, otherwise please do not waste your time :)
