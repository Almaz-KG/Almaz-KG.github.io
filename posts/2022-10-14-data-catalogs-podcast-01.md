<section class="article-content">

Right now, we're building a company wide place for managing the company's data assets. It should become a single workspace where engineers, data scientists, data analytics, products and managers can cooperate on top of the data assets.

Several weeks ago I was invited to have a conversion about modern data stack and Data Catalogs particularly.
So, here it is, the podcast. Hope you will find it usefull, otherwise please do not waste your time :)
